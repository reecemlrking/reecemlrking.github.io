    Hi! I'm Reece. I am a recent university graduate with a BSc in Computing Science and Physics.
    I love building things both physically and digitally. I fell in love with programming when I 
    decided to take a CS course out of curiosity, and quickly fell in love with the endless possibilities
    the field provided. Shifting degree focus, I pursued Computing Science throughout my Bachelors and have 
    since created many little projects throughout my degree both in the classroom and on my own.

    Outside of the programming space, I love climbing and hiking and just being physically active.
    I've recently competed in a climbing competition at my local gym and came in first place in my 
    division (intermediate). I love reading too! I'm currently working my way through Robert Jordan's
    expansive Wheel of Time series, and I'm loving every page. Though I haven't hade much time as of late, 
    I love gaming both digitally and physically with board/card games. Some of my favorite games in the 
    digital world are: Elden Ring, Sekiro, Stardew Valley, and Doom Eternal. I'm an avid TTRPG player too
    and love to play Dungeons and Dragons with my friends and family.
